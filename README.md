# tamagotchi-project

This was a mini project for General Assembly Software Engineering program.

To start the game, enter a name for your pet and click "Submit."

If the pet's hunger, sleepiness, or boredom reach 10, the pet will die. To prevent this, use the "feed," "lights," and "play" buttons. "Feed" and "play" will reduce hunger and boredom by 1, respectively. "Lights" will reset sleepiness to 1.
